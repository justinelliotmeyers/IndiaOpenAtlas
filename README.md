Daily Recaps:

1 - Admin 0/1 Capitals. Confirmed all capitals but one. Some states have more than one capital; optimized data to fall in urban core if possible. All manually confirmed and edited. Names have several spellings (IE Amaravati / Amaravathi in Andhra Pradesh).

2 - Finished admin 1 capitals and verified missing one (Bhararisain, Uttarakhand). Started district capitals/ headquarter mapping. 

3 - District mapping: 	ANDAMAN AND NICOBAR ISLANDS, ANDHRA PRADESH, ARUNACHAL PRADESH, ASSAM, BIHAR. https://lgdirectory.gov.in/ ARUNACHAL PRADESH has 25 districts. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_districts_of_Arunachal_Pradesh ARUNACHAL PRADESH has 26 disticts.
