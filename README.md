2)Identify and optimize urban core for admin 2 capitals.

Daily Recaps:

1 - Admin 0/1 Capitals. Confirmed all capitals but one. Some states have more than one capital; optimized data to fall in urban core if possible. All manually confirmed and edited. Names have several spellings (IE Amaravati / Amaravathi in Andhra Pradesh).

2 - Finished admin 1 capitals and verified missing one (Bhararisain, Uttarakhand). Started district capitals/ headquarter mapping. 

3 - District mapping: 	ANDAMAN AND NICOBAR ISLANDS, ANDHRA PRADESH, ARUNACHAL PRADESH, ASSAM, BIHAR. https://lgdirectory.gov.in/ ARUNACHAL PRADESH has 25 districts. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_districts_of_Arunachal_Pradesh ARUNACHAL PRADESH has 26 disticts.

4 - Pivot day. Clean folder structure; deleted geojson folder. Will focus on building out one full admin to see if this project is possible. Randomly picked ARUNACHAL PRADESH. Cleaned all district capitals. Kra Daadi district (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kra_Daadi_district ) wiki states Palin is capital (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palin,_Arunachal_Pradesh ). http://www.arunachalipr.gov.in/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/IPR_2019.pdf has Jamin flagged. Emails sent to https://censusindia.gov.in/ to find out if codes/ populations can be used and to document clear terms. ddu.rgi@nic.in rgi.rgi@nic.in websupport.rgi@nic.in

5 - Began mapping subdistrict hqs. DIFFICULT.

6 - Continued to map subdistrict hqs. Arunachal Pradesh has some remote mountainous areas with difficult to confirm locations. Even subdistricts themselves are a bit difficult to find data for. Probably not one of the easier states to randomly pick as the first to do, but every state will have unique challenges. Fixed admin capital. The rw NGA point for it was off. Some data if just really bad.
